        <h3>StudyPal - Android App<button class="expand" data-course="proj1">Expand</button></h3>
          <div id = "proj1" style="display:none">
            <p>I was the leader of a team of five individuals to create StudyPal, an Android app designed to facilitate student-tutor collaboration. 
            The project employed agile methodologies and version control tools like Git and JIRA. 
            The app's user interface, created using Java and XML, focused on simplicity and utility. 
            Secure registration and authentication were implemented using Firebase and SQLite.</p>

        <h3>GameAcademy - Web Development/strong<button class="expand" data-course="proj2">Expand</button></h3>
        <div id = "proj2" style="display:none">
          <p>In another project, GameAcademy, I developed a web-based platform for chess enthusiasts using C#.Net. 
            The platform provided a space for online play and strategic improvement. 
            The user interface was responsive, achieved through a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
            I integrated user feedback mechanisms to drive iterative enhancements.</p>

        <h3>Barcode Scanner - Python Application<button class="expand" data-course="proj3">Expand</button></h3>
        <div id = "proj3" style="display:none">
            In a Python-based endeavor, I engineered a program to detect barcodes from images. Matplotlib and image processing techniques were employed to accomplish accurate barcode identification, both for individual barcodes and multiple codes within a single image.</p>

      <h2>Beyond Tech</h2>
      <p>When I'm not immersed in coding or problem-solving, you'll find me engaging in hobbies that keep me balanced. Something Iâ€™m extremely proud of is being the captain of over 5 different competitive Badminton Teams throughout my teenage years. During this journey we have won numerous titles throughout New Zealand. More recently I have taken a keen interest in going to the gym, I believe maintaining a good physical body helps with keeping mentally healthy as well.</p>
